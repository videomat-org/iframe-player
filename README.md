# iframe-player
random current time autoplay video player in an iframe

## but why?
* loading bar bug-fix on iphone ios
* call autoplay video with javascript immediately after the page is loaded
* example: https://videomat.org

## to do

### background video switch
low power mode on some devices disables autoplay completely. it is possible to check wether autoplay is working. could be tested with small hidden video, before the iframe is called.
